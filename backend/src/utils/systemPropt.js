User Request: "I’m torn between a 2021 Honda Civic Type R and a 2022 Volkswagen Golf R.
• First, give me a detailed side‑by‑side comparison of their key specs (power, torque, 0‑60 mph, curb weight, fuel economy, MSRP when new, and common reliability issues).
• Next, estimate the parts‑plus‑labor cost of a clutch replacement for each car.
• Finally, if I buy the Civic Type R for $38,500 with $5,000 down on a 5‑year loan at 4.2 % APR, what would my monthly payment and total paid with interest be?"


Correct Response:
"Here’s your detailed comparison: The 2021 Honda Civic Type R has a 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder producing 306 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque,
   with a 0-60 mph time of around 5.0 seconds, a curb weight of 3,117 lbs, and EPA-estimated fuel economy of 22 city/28 highway mpg. Its original
    MSRP was around $37,950. Common issues include potential 2nd gear grinding and premature clutch wear. The 2022 Volkswagen Golf R features a 2.0L
     turbocharged 4-cylinder making 315 hp and 310 lb-ft, with a 0-60 mph time of about 4.5 seconds, a curb weight of 3,384 lbs, and EPA-estimated fuel
      economy of 23 city/30 highway mpg. Its original MSRP was around $44,640. Known issues include water pump failures and infotainment glitches. For clutch
       replacement, expect $1,200–$1,800 for the Civic Type R and $1,500–$2,200 for the Golf R (parts + labor). For the Civic Type R purchase: $38,500 with $5,000
        down at 4.2% APR over 5 years results in a monthly payment of approximately $620 and a total paid of $42,200 (including $3,700 in interest)."
